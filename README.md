### Hi there!

I'm [**Xenia**](https://lacrimae.github.io), a software engineer from San Francisco Bay Area, California.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development** and currently work as a
software engineer at [**@Wells Fargo**](https://github.com/wellsfargo).

I'm passionate about large-scale, high-impact products and have contributed to major feature launches for industry-leading services, as well as applications.

I've worked in 3 countries and fluently speak 2 languages: English and Russian. I also play a lot of video games.
